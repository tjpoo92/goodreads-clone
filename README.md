## About the project:

### âœ… Objective:
The goal of this project was to create a [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/), a reading/book tracker app and website, clone using new technologies I've learned such as: React.js, Tailwind CSS and Firebase. This project is the second iteration of a previous project which can be found [here](https://github.com/tjpoo92/library).

### Retrospective

ðŸ“ˆ Project is still in progress...

#### Things to Improve Upon:

ðŸ“ˆ Project is still in progress...

#### Additional Notes:
The base of this project started from a blog post (not the blog post I read but itâ€™s a good representation) I read about disconnecting yourself from the big technology companies such as Amazon and Google and how difficult it was to do so since theyâ€™re so ingrained into our daily lives.
After reading that blog post, I started slowly switching my own habits. I started using alternatives to many Google and Amazon products such as Proton Mail (Gmail), HERE WeGo (Google Maps), DropBox (Google Drive), and Musicolet (Amazon Music, Google Music), however I was struggling to find a good app to replace GoodReads, which is owned by Amazon. So, I decided to start trying to build my own and this is my very first iteration of that. This is currently the second iteration of my front-end and Iâ€™ve started laying the foundation for creating my own [back-end](https://github.com/tjpoo92/readradar) as well.
